Ann has been married twice before.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the author has not yet revealed the identity of her kids and their baby fathers.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith was born around 1956. She is a graduate of Idaho State University. Soon after graduating college, she started working as a dental hygienist.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/files.thefamilynation.com/uploads//posts/9d3d99e4-049f-4e39-8a8b-99adbd48bed3/ann-lesley-smith-author.webp></p><p>Besides her primary career as a dental hygienist, Ann has also worked as a model, author, police chaplain, radio host, and singer.&nbsp;</p><p>Ann is available on Facebook with 1.6k friends.

The former couple got married on August 24, 1985.</p><p>Ann's marriage to John immediately brought her into the elite class. She left her job as a dental hygienist as money was no longer a concern with her new family.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, Smith became accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle that included buying designer clothes, horse rides, and expensive cars. According to Ann, spending $65 thousand a month on clothes was not even a big deal.</p><p>Although the marriage seemed like a fairy tale, it also had a serious drawback. John was an alcoholic who often traumatized his wife. The author has accused her ex-husband of physical and mental abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>Ann and John split after less than four years as she filed for divorce on March 28, 1989. Before the wedding, Smith had signed a pre-nuptial agreement that limited the spousal support amount to $5 thousand per month for only six months. This led to the author facing a serious financial crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>To sustain her living, she started working odd jobs and also signed a few modeling contracts. She eventually met an event coordinator who introduced her to religion.</p><p>As Ann started preaching to the Lord Jesus Christ, she became detached from the materialistic world and started putting less value on money.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/files.thefamilynation.com/uploads//posts/9d3d99e4-049f-4e39-8a8b-99adbd48bed3/ann-lesley-smith.webp></p><h2 id=ann-lesley-smith-chester->She Was Married To Chester Smith For Three Years</h2><p>Ann Lesley and Chester Smith got married around 2005 and remained together for the next three years.
