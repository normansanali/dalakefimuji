His sophomore project, “Aaron’s Party,” released in 2000, was also a commercial success.</p><p>Unfortunately, Carter struggled to make the transition from child star to mature act. To make matters worse, his drug habit, combined with shady business dealings by his mother/manager, contributed to his net wealth decline.</p><h2><span id=Is_Aaron_Carter_related_to_another_person>Is Aaron Carter related to another person?</span></h2><p>Aaron Carter does not have a sibling. He, on the other hand, has twin sisters named Angel and Leslie. Leslie died in 2012 as a result of a drug overdose.
