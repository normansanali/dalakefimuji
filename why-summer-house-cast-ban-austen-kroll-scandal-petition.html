The page has over 2,000 signatures. Are Bravo fans really over Austen and his drama-filled life, or would they be willing to give the Trop Hop beer founder another chance?</p><h2 id=why-don-39-t-bravo-fans-want-austen-kroll-on-summer-house>Why Don't Bravo Fans Want Austen Kroll On Summer House?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop culture commentator Ryan Bailey </a>created the change.org petition to keep Austen from appearing in future seasons of Summer House and the newer spin-off series Winter House. This was after he had completely ruined any chance of a friendship forming between Ciara and Lindsay. "He is a menace to the summer house and pits women against each other," says Ryan in his opening remarks on the petition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Danielle gets a glass thrown at her for the love of god. He's playing multiple women at once, and that's just IN the actual summer house. Imagine what he's doing in public without cameras on him," wrote Ryan.</p><p>Many fans have echoed Ryan's remarks, as well. Twitter was ablaze during the Winter House and Summer House seasons featuring Austen. Fans began to turn on Austen after they witnessed the downfall of his "situationship" with Summer House star Ciara Miller.</p><p>The two got cozy during the first season of Bravo's Summer House spin-off series, Winter House, with the explosive culmination of their relationship taking place in the following season of Summer House.</p><p>"Watching two women fight over Austen on Summer House is mind-boggling, in what world does he seem like a decent catch? He's the ultimate eff boy, and he's never gonna change," tweeted one fan in response to the episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover's Relationship Made Summer House Far More Complicated, Here's How</a></span></p><p>The comment section of the change.org petition is cluttered with fans supporting Ryan's stance, as well. "I'm signing because Austen ruins everything. He is the worst. Keep him out of our precious Summer House," said one fan in the comments. "They cut all the fun stuff from Winterhouse to focus on Austin and Ciara's relationships/hookup. We missed everyone hanging out and having a fun time for that," said another commenter.</p><p>"With bare minimum effort, Bravo can do better than Austen. He is a flavorless boring man-child. He's like a stale chip -- LET'S MOVE ON," reads another comment from a Bravo Fan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-the-cast-of-summer-house-want-austen-kroll-banned-from-the-show>Does The Cast Of Summer House Want Austen Kroll Banned From The Show?</h2><p>While they've never straight out said they want Austen banned from the show, many of the women in the cast of Summer House aren't too keen on having him around. Ciara has made it clear that although she's moved past the drama with Austen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she doesn't see the two ever being friends</a>.</p><p>Paige DeSorbo and Austen have had many ups and downs in their friendship, and despite Paige being the girlfriend of <a href=#>one of Austen's closest friends</a>, we'd have to think she'd side with her girl Ciara in this case.</p><p>Lindsay Hubbard probably doesn't want Austen around anymore either, especially since she is now happily engaged to fellow summer house castmate Carl Radke. There's nothing weirder than an old flame being around your new fiancÃ©. Even if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austen and Lindsay truly squashed their beef at Bravocon 2022</a>, it's doubtful that Lindsay would be rooting for Austen to return to Summer House.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Madison LeCroy And Her Husband's Combined Net Worth And What They Do With All Their Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan also highlighted Austen's bizarre lie about texting Lindsay on New Year's Eve in 2020 as a reason he is not to be trusted.</p><p>"Also, he told Lindsay he wanted to date her on New Year's Eve and then said he couldn't be responsible for having texted that because he was at a Phish show. We later found out that it was an ONLINE show due to the pandemic. They also showed Austen dressed as the joker at a previous show which is a crime in and of itself. Muppet mouth must stop," said Ryan in the petition.</p><h2 id=do-fans-of-southern-charm-still-want-austen-kroll-on-the-show>Do Fans Of Southern Charm Still Want Austen Kroll On The Show?</h2><p>It's unclear if fans of Southern Charm are ready to say goodbye to Austen Kroll and his playboy lifestyle. Ryan Bailey doesn't think Austen needs to be removed from Southern Charm, saying in the petition, "He should feel free to continue with his southern charm compatriots but leave summer house alone 'from front to back.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Summer House drama <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">really affected Austen's relationship with Craig Conover</a>, with the men saying it took them months to repair their friendship after the show wrapped. Austen was worried the pair would never get back to where they were.</p><p>"I was like, 'Look, it will. Like, it's a roller coaster being on TV. You did some dumb stuff, but no one's perfect. Some things are worse than others.' But, you know, fortunately, with time, everyone can redeem themselves," said Craig to Page Six.</p><p>Prior to their breakup, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Flowers spoke very highly of Austen</a> and attempted to defend him against all the hate he was getting from Bravo fans. "Austen is a very sensitive guy, I don't know if that comes across to a lot of people, but I just think he is misunderstood," said Austen's now ex-girlfriend to Cheat Sheet. "He's made some bonehead moves, but for the most part, I don't think he at all deserves the backlash he's getting from people. I think people go really, really hard on him," said Olivia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also explained why she thought it was so easy for people to always make Austen out to be the bad guy. "I think he's easy for people to make him the villain, because he's the guy who can come across as like the party boy. And so I just didn't understand everyone's frustration with him. It does make me sad because I don't see him the way other people do. And anyone who really knows him doesn't think the same things that people are saying," said Olivia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqMKuucSrZKGnpaiybq%2FArKtmmpGjeqLB0q2cp2Wbp7ytuIysmpqmlJa5brzEraCtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./candice-crawford.html>&#171;&nbsp;Candice Crawford- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage</a>
