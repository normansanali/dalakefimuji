They only gave fans subtle glimpses into their supposed romance. <a href=#>The two met on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016</a>. But after years of appearing as friends to the public, they were finally seen kissing in pictures for the first time, confirming to fans that they were dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It came as no surprise when the relationship was once and for all 'confirmed' because fans had always recognized their chemistry on and off-screen. It is hard to estimate exactly when they started dating, but they have had their fair shares of moments in the public that can help fans guess how long they have been together for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Did Zendaya Make From 'Spider-Man' So Far?</a></span></p><h2 id=when-did-zendaya-and-tom-holland-start-dating>When Did Zendaya And Tom Holland Start Dating?</h2><p>It all started when they played love interests in the 2016 Spider-Man movie. After filming, the two did lots of press together and shared pictures on Instagram together. They were also constantly seen together in public and Holland even met Zendaya's family for dinner in New York City in 2017. This made fans speculate that the relationship was more than the 'friendship' they were making it out to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They shared their first on-screen kiss in Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019 as Peter and MJ. This fueled the fire even more that they were together because of their chemistry in the movie. In 2020, both Zendaya and Holland were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to be dating other people</a>. Zendaya was spotted with Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi and Tom Holland was seen with actress Nadia Parks.</p><p>The pair was seen together again on Tom's Instagram for Zendaya's 25th birthday.

This quickly added to the rumors and made them even more believable that the two were definitely not just friends.</p><p>At the December premiere for Spider-Man: No Way Home, <a href=#>Tom Holland stopped an interview mid-way</a> so he could watch Zendaya's entrance on the red carpet. Just last week the two were spotted at a Rangers game together along with Euphoria co-star Hunter Schafer and Holland's younger brother. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendaya and Tom sported matching couple jerseys with each other's names on the back</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were pictured together in Italy just a few days ago. Holland reportedly flew to Rome to surprise Zendaya for a night out. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendaya was described as seeming visibly thrilled</a>. The chef of the restaurant posted a picture of him with both Zendaya and Holland.</p><h2 id=did-zendaya-and-tom-holland-buy-a-house-together>Did Zendaya And Tom Holland Buy A House Together?</h2><p>Zendaya stars in the HBO series Euphoria as the main character Rue and is also an executive producer of the second season.

Well, <a href=#>Euphoria will definitely have a season 3 but there is no confirmed date.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zendaya Hated Shooting This Scene In 'Euphoria'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Tom Holland stars in a new movie called 'Uncharted'</a> that was released this month. While fans have been speculating that Zendaya and Holland have bought a house together in South London, but he has since denied it. On Live with Kelly and Ryan Holland said "I didn’t buy a new house, and "I’m like, wow, what a surprise, I wonder when I’ll get the keys." So while slightly public with their relationship, the two are keeping a lot of aspects of their life together private.</p><p>So while it is unclear the exact date or year Zendaya and Tom Holland started dating, it is quite clear that they finally are opening up about their love for each other. Fans are ecstatic to see into a small glimpse of their relationship that includes major support of each other's careers. Zendaya and Holland can be seen on screen together in the new Spider-Man: No Way Home movie. While they both have major upcoming projects and successful careers, it is clear that their relationship will continue to flourish and time will tell if the two decide to make it a more public one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Zendaya or Tom Holland: Which One Has More Instagram Followers?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2eYrGqsIyznKecka6ubq3NnWStp51itbC4y5qlnWWRmMG2rculsGarpJa%2FtXnDmquippdk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-are-millie-boyles-parents-meet-her-father-david-and-mother-shelley-boyle-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Are Millie Boyles Parents?
