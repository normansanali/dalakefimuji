His mother, Quavo, and Offset were among the family members who helped raise him in Lawrenceville. In the seventh grade, he began creating beats and rhythms, but he didn’t begin producing music professionally until 2011.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/P4-2-300x251.jpg.webp alt="Death of a Rapper" width=518 height=433 sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Career></span>TakeOff’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Takeoff started rapping in 2008, along with Quavo and Offset, who are also family members. The group’s original stage name was Polo Club, but they later switched to Migos. On August 25, 2011, the group released Juug Season, a mixtape that served as their debut full-length project. Then, on June 1, 2012, they released the mixtape “No Label.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Early_Work_with_Migos></span>TakeOff’s Early Work with Migos<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the 2013 release of their track “Versace,” Migos first gained notoriety. The song reached its peak positions at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 list and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart after being remixed by Canadian rapper Drake.</p><p>Chris Brown, Young Thug, and Murda Beatz all had cameo performances on their debut studio album, “Yung Rich Nation,” which was released in July 2015. The album’s position on the Billboard 200 peaked at number 17.</p><p>“Bad and Boujee,” a song by Migos featuring Lil Uzi Vert that peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of January 21, 2017, became the group’s first number-one single of 2016. The Recording Industry Association of America later awarded the song a platinum certification, making it four times platinum (RIAA). Takeoff is neither featured on the song nor given credit for it, even though he can be seen in one of the music video’s background sequences.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15942/production/_127468388_migos_gettyimages-1325805389.jpg alt="Takeoff with Migos and Offset rappers" width=713 height=401 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Takeoff has stated that he was preoccupied during the time of recording and was not included in the song. He was asked about his absence by hosts Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks during the filming of Complex’s Everyday Struggle at the 2017 BET Awards, to which he responded, “Does it seem like I’m leaving off “Bad and Boujee”?” Budden left the act in response to Takeoff, and before security intervened, a fight nearly broke out between the Migos and Budden and their entourages.</p><p>On January 27, 2017, Migos’ second studio album, Culture, was released. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 album-equivalent units, including 44,000 physical sales, in its first week. In July 2017, the album received a platinum certification in the nation.</p><p>On January 26, 2018, the group’s second album, Culture II, was made available. The album sold 199,000 equivalent units, including 38,000 sold copies, in its first week of release, becoming Migos’ second to make its number-one Billboard 200 debut.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Last_Rocket_and_Later_Migos_Work></span>TakeOff’s Last Rocket and Later Migos Work<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On October 23, 2018, Takeoff stated that The Last Rocket, a solo project, will be published the following month. This came after the release of Culture II. His first song off the album, “Last Memory,” and its accompanying music video were made public two days following the announcement. The release day for the album was November 2, 2018.</p><p>On June 11, 2021, the fourth Migos album, Culture III, was made available. This would be the last Migos album to be made public while Takeoff was alive.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Friction_within_Migos_and_Only_Built_for_Infinity_Links></span>TakeOff’s Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>According to allegations that Quavo’s ex-girlfriend Saweetie had an affair with Offset, there were talks of the Migos breaking up in October 2022. After that, on October 7, 2022, 25 days before Takeoff passed away in Houston on November 1, 2022, Quavo and Takeoff released their joint album, Only Built for Infinity Links.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Georgia_Southern_University_Incident></span>TakeOff’s Georgia Southern University Incident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The 2015 Spring Concert at Hanner Fieldhouse at Georgia Southern University was slated to feature Migos as the headlining act on April 18, 2015. Local opening artists kicked off the performance at 7:00 pm, but the band didn’t take the stage until about an hour and a half after their stated set time of 9:00 pm. The ensemble played for less than 30 minutes before departing the stage, despite their performance contract calling for a minimum 45-minute set.</p><p>To provide security for the event, the University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department, and the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office were present. When they smelled marijuana coming from the group’s vans, they interrogated the drivers. Further investigation led to the arrest of the rap group along with 12 members of their group for possession of marijuana and another controlled drug, possession of a firearm in a school safety zone, possession of a handgun while committing a crime, and felon in possession of a firearm.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/hip-hopvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Offset-trends-on-Twitter-in-the-wake-of-Takeoffs-passing-2.jpg alt="Offset trends on Twitter in the wake of Takeoff's passing" width=737 height=436 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Even though the group’s notoriety was known to university officials, they nonetheless permitted them to play since the student body had chosen them as one of the seven artists to perform, and the performance was funded by student fees and ticket sales. The ensemble was expected to get $30,000 under the terms of the performance contract, plus another $3,000 for its promoter, Big House Collective. Due to the group’s tardy entrance, truncated performance, and possession of illegal substances on university grounds, university officials first tried to declare Migos in breach of the contract; nonetheless, the institution finally paid half of the agreed-upon costs.</p><p>Takeoff, Quavo, and six other people in their group were freed on bail by the Bulloch County District Attorney’s Office on April 20, 2015. However, Offset and six other people remained in detention without bond. On April 28, 2015, Migos said they will postpone their Yung Rich Nation Tour until July as a result of their arrests.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Sexual_Assault_Allegations></span>TakeOff’s Sexual Assault Allegations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On August 5, 2020, word spread that Takeoff had been identified as the defendant in a civil action brought by a female victim alleging that he had committed acts of sexual abuse, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and interference with civil rights at a party in Los Angeles in June of that year.</p><p>On April 2, 2021, it was announced that Takeoff wouldn’t be prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office since there wasn’t enough proof. The judicial process for the civil lawsuit is still ongoing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=TakeOffs_Death></span>TakeOff’s Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At 810 Billiards & Bowling in Houston, Texas, on November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and murdered. According to the local Houston KHOU-11 TV breaking news, he and around 40 individuals gathered outside the bowling facility after a private party there concluded at 1:00 a.m. CST. Quavo, a fellow Migos member and Takeoff’s uncle, had earlier in the evening shared a video of himself and James Prince celebrating James Prince’s birthday while driving about Houston. The Houston Chronicle and TMZ both stated that a dice game ended in an altercation, which then resulted in a deadly gunshot.</p><p>According to the Houston Police Department, shooting occurred at 2:40 a.m. CST, and the victim was discovered dead when police arrived. Two other victims were transported to hospitals in private cars. The agency then noted that the victim’s identity won’t be made public until his family has been contacted and his identification has been confirmed by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. After the incident, Houston police verified that Takeoff had perished.</p><p>During the incident, other people were also injured, but not seriously.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tribute_to_TakeOff_Rapper></span>Tribute to TakeOff Rapper<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Social media was inundated with condolences.
