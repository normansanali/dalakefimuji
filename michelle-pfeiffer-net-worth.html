Kelley.</p><p>As one of the highest-paid Hollywood actresses, Pfeiffer has amassed a sizable fortune over the course of her career.</p><p>Similarly, as mentioned before, she is one of the most beautiful women in the world, which has enabled her to garner considerable riches from brand endorsements.</p><p>Aside from that, Pfeiffer has traded several pieces of real estate in some of the posh neighborhoods across the United States along with her husband, ultimately solidifying the family fortune.</p><h3>Film Earnings</h3><p>The breakthrough for the actress came in 1983 when she starred alongside Al Pacino in the crime drama film Scarface. From that point onwards, it was all uphill for the actress.</p><p>In 1988, she starred in the comedy crime film Married With the Mob as Angela de Marco, for which she was paid a mere <strong>$750,000</strong>.</p><p>The amount seems surprisingly low but let’s not forget the fact that it was more than 34 years ago, and the dollar was still above inflation.</p><p>If converted, that’s like earning a little north of $2 million in today’s money.</p><p>Similarly, her portrayal of Frankie in the 1991 rom-com Frankie and Johnny, which co-starred Al Pacino, earned her $3 million.</p><p>Well, that’s still not even close enough to what she made from her future acting pursuits.</p><p>Her one of the most admired roles as Cat Woman in the 1992 film Batman Returns made her another $3 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Michelle-Pfeiffer-Satwaman-1024x745.jpg><p>The figure seems astonishingly low as the film itself grossed $266.89 million at the global box office.</p><p>The film stars legendary Michael Keaton as the protagonist, and other famous casts include Christopher Waken and Danny DeVito.</p><p>Moreover, her role, which garnered her Academy Award nomination for Louanne Johnson from the film Dangerous Minds, earned her $6 million.</p><p>Pfeiffer as Beth Cappadora in the 1999 drama film The Deep End of the Ocean made a career-high $12 million.</p><p>Without going into much detail, it’s about $19 million in today’s money.</p><p>Aside from that, Pfeiffer earned $10 million for the supernatural horror-thriller film What Lies Beneath.</p><h2>Net Worth of Michelle Pfeiffer in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look at Michelle Pfeiffer’s net worth in different currencies, including Bitcoin.</p><table
