He was a Hollywood staple in the '90s and '00s, but the obsession with him seemed to die down later on in his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thing is, the actor is still working, and still earning plenty of money. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s net worth is pretty impressive, and he could stop working today if he wanted to. But fans seem to think that he should have more cash to his name after all his years of hard work.</p><h2 id=what-is-cuba-gooding-jr-s-net-worth>What Is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Net Worth?</h2><p>Thanks to his decades-long career in film, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s net worth is pretty impressive at $14 million. His most recent cash cow seems to have been 'American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson,' the 2016 TV show that earned Gooding a handful of nominations for his acting.</p><p>After all these years, he's clearly still got it -- though he's spent more time off of the set than he has&nbsp;on in recent years.</p><h2 id=how-did-cuba-gooding-jr-make-his-money>How Did Cuba Gooding Jr. Make His Money?</h2><p>Obviously, Cuba earned his net worth by acting, and a handful of big-name films really helped pad his pockets. Gooding has appeared in high-drama productions and then served as comic relief in less high-stakes roles. His range is one of the things that fans love about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after a&nbsp;stint in the spotlight, earning millions per film, Cuba turned toward more independent films to flex his acting chops. Might that be why his net worth isn't as high as it could possibly be?</p><h2 id=why-isn-t-cuba-gooding-jr-s-net-worth-higher>Why Isn't Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Net Worth Higher?</h2><p>Given his early successes, fans really want to know why Cuba Gooding Jr.'s net worth isn't much higher.</p><p>After all, he appeared in films with stars like Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and&nbsp;many more over the course of his career. He's even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten close to Claudine De Niro</a> as a result of working with Robert De Niro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, he rubbed elbows with many famous faces very&nbsp;early in his career. And that's part of the reason fans are so surprised he's not worth a ton more cash.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Truth About Robert De Niro's Custody Battle Over His Youngest Daughter" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Robert De Niro's Custody Battle Over His Youngest Daughter</a></span></p><p>Did he just not get paid enough per film?&nbsp;For example, how much did Cuba Gooding Jr. make for 'Jerry Maguire'? As it turns out, he seems to have made a decent income per project; Cuba apparently earned $600K for his role as Rod Tidwell.</p><p>And after that? He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned</a> $1.5M each for 'Men of Honor' and 'What Dreams May Come.' Some of his films around that time even earned $2M or more.</p><p>Those movies were in the late '90s and early '00s, though. After that, Cuba had a string of not-so-impressive films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-lot-of-cuba-gooding-jr-s-projects-went-straight-to-video>A Lot Of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Projects Went Straight To Video</h2><p>Though he partook in many a blockbuster early in his career, Cuba later hit a tough spot that involved a ton of direct-to-video movies. His streak of bad luck seemed to start in the early 2000s when he started receiving Raspberry awards for 'worst actor.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="This Academy Award Winner Might've Been Cancelled By 'SNL'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Academy Award Winner Might've Been Cancelled By 'SNL'</a></span></p><p>Sure, he had some hits in between (and&nbsp;was nominated for Best Actor in various awards categories), but most of those direct-to-video movies are long forgotten today. That means very few, if any, royalties.</p><p>Despite those earlier box office mega-hits, Cuba's net worth couldn't continue on its uptick. Plus, at the same time he was earning a lot of cash, Gooding was also purchasing various properties and, of course,&nbsp;spending some of his earnings.</p><h2 id=recent-scandals-haven-t-helped-cuba-s-career>Recent Scandals Haven't Helped Cuba's Career</h2><p>Unfortunately for Gooding, recent scandals haven't helped his image or his resume much. As of 2020, news outlets reported that prosecutors had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> more than 30 women had brought allegations against Gooding over inappropriate behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "groping case" involved "accusations of unwanted touching" by Gooding, and the charges involved three separate incidents.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="How Chris Hansen's Controversies Affected His $1.5 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Chris Hansen's Controversies Affected His $1.5 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While Gooding's defense claimed that witness accounts would prove that their client was innocent, the fact that 30 different women spoke out suggests that the case was about more than those three charges.</p><p>Regardless of the case's outcome, it clearly had an impact on Cuba's career. With the #MeToo movement bringing attention to these types of cases, it's unlikely that many fans will stick by Gooding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And it may also mean he has fewer film and TV opportunities, which means his net worth may stall right where it's at. Although in the scheme of things (even though he's no Brad Pitt), $15M is nothing to scoff at!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Vin Diesel Almost Lost His Entire Net Worth Because Of This Film" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vin Diesel Almost Lost His Entire Net Worth Because Of This Film</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiarpqRYrSwu8OipaBlmqd6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./five-nights-at-freddys-age-rating-and-parents-guide.html>&#171;&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddys age rating and parents guide</a>
