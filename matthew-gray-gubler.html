Gubler was cast as a brilliant FBI agent on the hit show Criminal Minds after interning with director Wes Anderson. Gubler was also in (500 Days) of Summer.</span></p><h2><span>Early life</span></h2><p><strong><span>Gubler was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 9, 1980.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;His father, John Gubler, is an attorney and his mother, Marilyn Kelch Gubler, is a rancher, political consultant, and former chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Party. Gubler majored in theater at the Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts in Las Vegas. He states, however, that he had no intention of becoming an actor; he simply thought that theater class would be fun and that acting would help him develop public speaking skills that would be useful in another career. “At the academy, my friends and I joked that our specialty was Acting, not Occupation 101,” he recalled. “I thought it would help me become a lawyer or something, or at least help me speak in public. That’s how I felt about that school.”</span></p><p><span>Despite his reservations, Gubler excelled in acting and appeared in numerous plays at the prestigious school. “I was in Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Importance of Being Earnest, and I also got to play The Cat in the Hat and The Mad Hatter, two of my favorite fictional psychopaths,” Gubler recalled. “Those were entertaining shows. That’s something I miss. I wish I could go back in time.” However, he had never considered acting as a career. «I never thought I would make a living acting; Still, it’s a surprise for my family and friends to see my face on TV every Wednesday night,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Gubler attended the University of California, Santa Cruz after graduating from Las Vegas Academy in 1998. He soon changed his major to film and directing at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. He graduated in 2002 and a modeling agent saw him walking down the street and stopped him and asked if he wanted to pursue a modeling career. According to Gubler, who does not consider himself particularly attractive, the agent saw potential in him only because “emaciated Muppet-looking weirdos” were popular as male models at the time. However, Gubler quickly rose to become one of New York City’s most sought-after male models over the next two years. He has appeared in print advertisements and runway shows for prestigious fashion houses such as Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Tommy Hilfiger, Sisley and Kate Spade.</span></p><h2><span>Profession and career of Matthew Gray Gubler</span></h2><p><span>Matthew Gray Gubler began his career as a model.
