Before getting cast in Fresh Off the Boat, she was deep in debt. The celebrity almost quit acting in favor of a more practical career. However, she didn't give up, and now Wu is a well-respected actress in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=activism-reading-and-that-pet-bunny>Activism, Reading, And That Pet Bunny</h2><p>The 38-year-old actress is also outspoken about various issues, including whitewashing, Asian representation, and more. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She is the founding supporter of the Time's Up movement that sparked a conversation about equality</a>, representation across all cultures, backgrounds, and sexual orientations, as well as abilities.</p><p>Wu also openly treated Casey Affleck's 2017 Oscar nomination highlighting his past legal issues with sexual misconduct.

It took quite some time to find the right actress to bring the story to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jon M. Chu, director of the film, revealed that he did not want to leave any stone unturned when he started his quest to find the right actors to portray the novel's unique characters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Money Has Tom Cruise Made From The ‘Mission Impossible’ Franchise?</a></span></p><p>Ross Butler was one of the actors who auditioned for Nick Young's role during the casting process. While Ross's recent on-screen credits are just straight-up high school roles, he was still given a chance to audition for Nick's character, a history professor in the film. But he did not end up with the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It ended up going to Henry Golding. But before Henry was cast, he didn't want the role mainly because he wasn't an actor. At the time, Henry was working as an on-camera travel host. However, persistence is key, and Henry eventually took on Nick's part making this movie his very first acting credit.</p><p>And speaking of persistence, that's what got Constance Wu her part in the movie as the leading lady Rachel Chu. Well, perseverance and a little heartfelt email. In a Q&A with Channel 24, Constance revealed that she almost wasn't cast as Rachel after meeting with Jon and a producer of the film Nina Jacobson because of scheduling conflicts with her TV series Fresh Off the Boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then something clicked in her mind, and Constance was determined to try and make it work out because she wanted to be a part of Crazy Rich Asians so badly. After a few screen tests, she got the role of Rachel.</p><p>Crazy Rich Asians was a global box-office smash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">generating 238.5 million USD worldwide</a>. Undoubtedly, Wu earned a lot of money starring this film.</p><h2 id=hustlers>Hustlers</h2><p>Constance Wu plays Destiny, a single mom who becomes a stripper to support her family. Her role model in the film is Ramona, played by Jennifer Lopez, who is the leader of the group of dancers.</p><p>The Fresh Off the Boat actress got into her Hustlers' character by going undercover at a strip club. Surprisingly, Wu made 600 USD on her first night. Constance also installed a stripper pole in her living room so she could practice at home. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The movie was a big success earning 157.6 million USD</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Constance Wu has amassed her 6 million USD net worth thanks to her persistence, dedication, and fantastic talent.
