In fact, it was not even close to love at first sight for her.</p><p>Ospreay was pretty certain he had blown his chance of dating Bea after his nervous approach at introducing himself. As he walked up to Bea, he accidentally messed up his line with the infamous, 'Will, my name is Hi'. Of course, he wanted to say 'Hi, my name is Will'.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>Watch: Will Ospreay & Bea Priestley vs Ricochet & Tessa Blanchard - Highlights</strong></p><p></p><p>Will was so nervous he could barely ooze any confidence talking to Priestley during their very first meeting.

For this, he had thought of moving there along with his girlfriend Bea.</p><p>There was just one issue, however. It hadn't been long since Priestley shifted to England from New Zealand, so she would be reluctant to move to a new place so soon. Moreover, the only reason she moved in the first place was, pro wrestling was almost non-existent in the place she resided, and she was desperate to train at Progress Wrestling.</p><p><strong>Watch: Moving in Chrome (Bea Priestley and Will Ospreay 2019 MV)</strong></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNQpkkvaA10</p><p>Speaking on the <strong>Chris Jericho</strong> podcast, Ospreay talked about how the move would be good for both the duo, since flying to Japan where he spends the majority of the time is quicker from Australia than his native England.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Quite clearly Will is looking forward to a new challenge while his girlfriend's still got unfinished business in the United Kingdom.</p><h2>Bea Priestley was diagnosed with a brain tumor at 14; underwent surgery at 18</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/ezgif.com-resize-9.png alt="Bea Priestley was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 14 and underwent surgery at 18." width=450 height=283 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Bea Priestley was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 14 and underwent surgery at 18.</strong><br><strong>Source: Bea Priestley's Instagram Post</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Back in October 2016, Bea revealed she had undergone a brain surgery two years earlier. The pro wrestler was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was just 14 years old.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>SPW Insider</a>, Bea revealed she does not remember much about her surgery since she was knocked out at the time. The toughest part, however, was the recovery afterward as she wasn't allowed to run for two months and not allowed into the gym for six months.</p><p>This experience only made her stronger as she got more and more motivated to prove the doubters wrong. Her hard work and persistence paid off as she not just recovered, she fulfilled her life-long dream of making it as a pro wrestler.</p><p>Visit <strong><a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a></strong> for more <strong><a href=#>biography</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>gossip</a></strong>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiZnpldpb%2BqsdKto56xXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./big-brothers-taylor-hale-and-joseph-abdin-reunite-after-split.html>&#171;&nbsp;Big Brother's Taylor Hale and Joseph Abdin Reunite After Split</a>
