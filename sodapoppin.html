He uploaded his first video in 2012 in which he was playing a popular game called ‘Amnesia 2’.</p><p>He initially posted some random videos without giving much thought to the content. He created the channel just to have fun but to his surprise, his channel became popular within a year and managed to acquire a considerable number of followers.</p><p>Furthermore, when he moved to Michigan his social media career received a major boost. After starting by posting videos on ‘World of Warcraft’, he began to expand his horizons and started playing games of different genres.</p><p>Morris has collaborated with fellow YouTuber Sky Williams who has appeared on his channel on several occasions.
