But is everyone really as nice as they seem? When we hear the word “diva”, our minds usually go to female stars like Mariah Carey or Beyoncé (who are not country singers), while we tend to think of those who sing country music as being more down-to-earth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, that’s not the case.</p><p>Like any other genre of music, the country music genre has its fair share of stars with “diva-like” attitudes, who believe that they should get certain things due to their fame, and due to the fact that they feel relatively untouchable...but you’ll notice that it’s the sweethearts who get the warmest praise.</p><p>Here are 10 country stars who are absolute sweeties, and 10 who carry that diva persona.</p><h2 id=kelsea-ballerini-sweetie><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Kelsea Ballerini (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>This country singer-songwriter has been known to be a downright darling to her fanbase... and they all sing her praises. This may be because she was raised in a modest setting (her father was a former sales manager at a radio station and her mom was in marketing) in Knoxville, Tennessee. She is constantly giving back...and being sweet while doing so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dolly-parton-sweetie><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Dolly Parton (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>Everyone and I repeat, EVERYONE, knows who Dolly Parton is. She rose to fame decades ago and slayed in the country music scene, changing country music entirely. Then, she crossed over to film and television and slayed there!</p><p>Because she’s a superstar, you wouldn’t expect her to be nice and down-to-earth – but she is VERY much so.</p><h2 id=maddie-and-tae-sweeties><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Maddie And Tae (Sweeties)</span></h2><p>The young country duo, Maddie and Tae, have a very girl next door-like air in all surroundings, and their niceness always shows. The duo met while they were being sent to the same vocal coach. They went to the same showcase in Dallas. From there, the rest is history. Take a gander at their Instagram feeds and you’ll fall head over heels.</p><h2 id=cam-sweetie><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Cam (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>You will NOT find a fan (or pretty much anyone) who has met this country singer/songwriter who has something bad to say about her. Do you know that this California girl can actually sing in 14 different languages? It’s something she learned while performing in the Contra Costa Children’s Chorus. She has every reason to be a diva, but she’s not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reba-mcentire-sweetie><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Reba McEntire (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>Like Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire is a whole different breed of country superstar. When you think country music sensation, Reba is probably the name that immediately comes to mind...and with good reason.</p><p>Reba is said to greet her fans with a sense of familiarity that most stars lack. She’s always insanely sweet to everyone who approaches her.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-sweetie><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Kelly Clarkson (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>Singer Kelly Clarkson rose to fame so extremely fast, via American Idol (the first season, no less) that no one would really blame her if she took on that diva persona. But she didn’t. In fact, she’s about as far away from it as one can get. She still has that small-town realism to her and she’s not afraid to show it.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-sweetie><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Shania Twain (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>If you’re a millennial, you know exactly who Shania Twain is and couldn’t ignore her for the life of you. She successfully crossed platforms in the 90s, with hits like “Man! I Feel like a Woman!” and “You’re Still the One”. She moved into a more adult contemporary music level. Did that give her a big head? Not in the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lee-ann-womack-sweetie><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Lee Ann Womack (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>If you’ve never heard of the song, “I Hope You Dance,” then you’ve been living under a rock for the past two decades. Like Twain, singer Lee Ann Womack seemed to cross over platforms with a single song. She’s been known to be an absolute sweetheart to fans when they approach her, and never turns down an autograph. Not many stars do that.</p><h2 id=melissa-peterman-sweetie><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Melissa Peterman (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>Okay, so Melissa Peterman is NOT a country singer, but rather an honorary country superstar. You might recognize her from the show,&nbsp;Reba, where she starred opposite Reba McEntire. They are actually extremely close friends in real life and Peterman went on tour with Reba, opening up for her with a comedy routine. She’s just as sweet as Reba, too.</p><h2 id=sara-evans-sweetie><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sara Evans (Sweetie)</span></h2><p>Singer Sara Evans’ modesty comes from her childhood: tragically, Evans was struck by an automobile in front of her house when she was only eight. She would sing from her wheelchair to help pay for her own medical bills. At 10, she recorded her first single. That would make ANYONE a diva, but not Evans, who takes her modest nature seriously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carrie-underwood-diva><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Carrie Underwood (Diva)</span></h2><p>As yet another American Idol up-and-comer, it’s a shame that Carrie Underwood didn’t get any of Kelly Clarkson’s modesty. While she’s sweet to some fans, others have said she’s only nice when she knows people are watching. If no cameras are around, she’s said to go ice cold...and acts like a snob to fans. That’s never a good thing.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-diva><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Taylor Swift&nbsp; (Diva)</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift is an international sensation and can’t go anywhere on the planet without being recognized, and, sometimes, that can get to a person. Fans have remarked that she’s sometimes very fake and almost plastic-like when it comes to meet-and-greets. I mean, you can’t constantly wear a happy face when you’re as busy as she is, though.</p><h2 id=wynonna-judd-diva><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Wynonna Judd&nbsp; (Diva)</span></h2><p>We have ALL heard horror stories about the music duo, The Judds (which consisted of Wynonna and her mother, Naomi), and how their diva behavior would cause stirs. Wynonna was known to be rude to makeup artists and hairstylists during her younger years thanks to fame. Here’s hoping that she learned from her younger mistakes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=faith-hill-diva><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Faith Hill (Diva)</span></h2><p>When she was just starting out in her career, Faith Hill was said to be extremely likable, by all&nbsp;of her fans. She was deeply appreciative of everyone around her. But, as her fame grew, so did her diva attitude. However, can you seriously blame her? Her entire life was lived out on the stage, while cameras flashed – it’s enough to make anyone tired.</p><h2 id=miranda-lambert-diva><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Miranda Lambert (Diva)</span></h2><p>Miranda Lambert has that extremely lovable and cute face, along with a smooth voice that makes fans adore her, but is she as grateful for them? She got her country music star rise on Nashville Star and has been flying high ever since. But, like some stars, she can be irritable at times with her fans, who then say she’s a diva.</p><h2 id=loretta-lynn-diva><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Loretta Lynn (Diva)</span></h2><p>“Diva” can be a pretty difficult word to pin down, since it switches meanings. Loretta Lynn is the ULTIMATE country music diva, and she wears that as a badge of honor. She came up the ranks when country music was basically a boy’s club, and she cleaned house at her concerts. Thanks to that, she’s one of the most known names in country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leann-rimes-diva><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>LeAnn Rimes (Diva)</span></h2><p>LeAnn Rimes was extremely young when she became super famous in the country music world (she was only 14 when she hit the big time), so it’s natural that she developed some diva-like attributes...due to living almost her whole life in the spotlight. She also received negative press for her personal life in her later years, which didn’t help much.</p><h2 id=trisha-yearwood-diva><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Trisha Yearwood (Diva)</span></h2><p>I mean, Trisha Yearwood is married to one of the NICEST men in country music (the one and only Garth Brooks) so how diva-like can she be? Well, apparently VERY diva-like. Sometimes, she can be short with fans, but you can’t really put that on her since she’s an extremely hard worker and just can’t find the time for long convos with fans.</p><h2 id=gretchen-wilson-diva><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gretchen Wilson (Diva)</span></h2><p>While Gretchen Wilson is widely-known in the country music world, she’s not really a popular name in the music world as a whole. Apparently, she doesn’t really need major fame to take on some diva-like mannerisms...especially when it comes to fans. Some fans have said that she’s often cold and unapproachable. That’s never a great thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martina-mcbride-diva><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Martina McBride (Diva)</span></h2><p>Despite her youthful glow, Martina McBride has actually been around the country music scene for a long time, so she too has earned her “diva” badge. She’s VERY protective over her family, especially her children, so she takes no bull from anyone when it comes to them. And if that makes her seem like a diva, then so be it.</p><p>References: Reddit.com, Grammys.com, Cmt.com, Biography.com, Instagram.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWmrqiuMRmmqitnqm%2FunnMrqqim12owaK%2B0mauoaddlr%2BmedKwnJ6smJqus8DSZmhpZaedvG6t0Z5kraeklrlusMivmKxn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alahna-ly.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alahna Ly Wiki, Age, Height, Biography, Family, Boyfriend, Affairs, More</a>
