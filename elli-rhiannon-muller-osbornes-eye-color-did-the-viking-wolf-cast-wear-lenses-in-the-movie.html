Yes, the Viking cast didn’t wear any lenses in the movie. Looking at her Instagram, we can confirm that the Norwegian actress has grey colored eyes since her childhood.</strong></p><p>A new horror film is always great, and <strong>Netflix</strong> has a few in February, including The Strays,Re/Member, and <strong>Viking Wolf</strong>. Viking Wolf is Norway’s first werewolf film to explore the werewolf myth in a Norwegian context. Thale Berg, a 17-year-old girl who travels to a small town with her mother Liv, a police officer, is the center of the horror-thriller movie.</p><p>Thale is at the heart of the inquiry when a girl is attacked at a party since she was there and saw what happened. In addition to defending the community from a supernatural threat, Liv attempts to uncover the murder mystery. Stig Svendsen, the director, has combined Nordic mythology with paranormal phenomena to create an interesting one-of-a-kind film.</p><p>The lead role of Thale is played by <strong>Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne</strong>. Since the arrival of the movie on the streaming platforms, many viewers have been obsessed with Elli’s beauty, especially her grey/gray eyes. As a result, some people wonder if she wore lenses for the movie. Well, let’s find it out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=elli-rhiannon-muller-osbornes-eye-color-the-viking-wolf-cast-has-greygray-eyes-in-real-life-as-well></span>Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne’s Eye Color: The Viking Wolf Cast Has Grey/Gray Eyes in Real Life as Well!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With unique eye colors, you can always impress people. Similarly, <strong>Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne</strong> (@ellirmuller) has very beautiful grey/gray eyes in Viking Wolf. While many believe she wore lenses for her role in the movie, we can confirm that the eye color shown in the movie is her natural eyes.</p><p>Yes, we scrolled through Elli’s Instagram and examined many pictures of her. We could see her grey eyes in every picture. When you look at her eyes closely, you almost believe they’re unnatural. However, it seems she was born with very unique and beautiful eyes.&nbsp;Since she is a Norwegian actress, we can understand why her eyes look so unique as Norwegian people are known for their variation of eye color. Now, let’s get to know more about the Thale actress.</p><p>Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne was born in Oslo, Norway on January 10, 2000. She made her acting debut in the 2018 movie Utoya – July 22, which came out the same year as the Netflix adaptation of the horrific terrorist assault that took place in July 2011. She became well-known in 2019 as a part of the television series, Psychobitch. According to some reports, she is of Norwegian, Spanish, and Caucasian ethnicity born under the sign of Aquarius, and she identifies as female.</p><p>Talking about her personal life, she does not seem to have a boyfriend right now. However, there’s a high chance she might be dating in private as she prefers to keep her personal life private.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=viking-wolf-is-gudbrand-the-grim-based-on-a-real-viking></span>Viking Wolf: Is Gudbrand the Grim Based on a Real Viking?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The history of Gudbrand the Grim plays a crucial role in framing the events of Viking Wolf. The journey the monster took with the Viking leader to reach Norway is said to be the inspiration for the movie’s title. As a result, the movie practically establishes Gudbrand the Grim as a figure in Norse mythology. The figure, nevertheless, doesn’t seem to be based on a historical Viking. There is a story about a guy by the name of Gudbrand in Norse legend. The word is derived from the Old Norse word Guðbrandr. Its translation is “God’s Sword.”</p><p>Gudbrand is a farmer rather than a Viking in the Norse folktale “Gudbrand on the Hill-side.” Gudbrand and his wife are at the center of the narrative as they deal with a series of upsetting incidents on their farm. Gudbrand is seen as an impulsive person whose choices frequently get him into problems. The positivity that can be found in any circumstance is the story’s main subject. As a consequence, it is clear that the Gudbrand from the folktale has nothing in common with the character from the movie.</p><p>The legends of Haakon Sigurdsson, better known as Haakon Jarl, the king of Norway, speak of a real Viking called Gudbrand. However, as Haakon lived in the tenth century and was slain by a werewolf, it seems improbable that Gudbrand from the movie is based on this Viking.</p><p>Additionally, we were unable to uncover any information on the 11th-century activities of a Viking general by the name of Gudbrand. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the producers invented Gudbrand the Grim as a mythical Viking. Gudbrand’s tale, however, adds an intriguing new dimension to werewolf mythology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2cobZuvseimKemn6N6rsHLpZyrZZ%2Bor7C%2BzZ6qZp2pmnqku8uoqWacmZl6tbTEZq2io5mjtG7DzqWdZpuRqMFuw8SaqWaklaPApr%2BMoqVmrJiaeq671aKcaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-intel-b560-motherboard-overview-30-budget-models-for-rocket-lake.html>&#171;&nbsp;GIGABYTE B560M Aorus Pro AX &amp;amp; B560M Aorus Pro</a>
